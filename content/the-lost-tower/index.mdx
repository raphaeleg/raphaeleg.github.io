# Core Challenges

1. **Time Limit**: How to create a complete game within 48 hours?
2. **Designer-Friendly**: Given the limited manpower, I cannot implement everything alone. How to make it easy for others to implement my script?
3. **Multiple Genres**: As a puzzle game with visual novel elements, How to implement these genre features seamlessly?

# Core Solutions

1. **Generic**: Simple and generic scripts are fast to implement and highly reusable.
2. **Expandable with Interface**: Have few core scripts, with few public variables for easy understanding of how to implement the scripts.
3. **UML Diagrams**: Quickly sketch out class diagrams to understand the whole system before implementation.

## Generic Code

	alt='Intractable'
	sizes='100vw'
/>

For any interactable object in the current scene, it requires only three things:

1. Whether the Player is near it → `is_in_range`
2. The trigger to interact with it → `trigger`
3. What to do on interact → `on_success`

This script makes it **easy for designers** to make objects interactable with any keybind needed.

### Dialogue System

Using six classes, the game had an expandable dialogue system that was **user-friendly for designers**.

---|--- 1. `DialogueStructure`: A sentence may require a sprite, the name of the
character talking, what they're saying, and a sound effect 2. `Dialogue`: A dialogue
consist of several sentences, that can be represented with a `DialogueStructure`
3. `ChoiceStructure`: A choice consist of a description of what it is, and what it
does 4. `Choices`: Player may choose multiple choices, that can be represented with
a `ChoiceStructure` 5. `DialogueManager`: To keep track of whether a dialogue is
running 6. `DialogueInterface`: To make a new dialogue, it references a `Dialogue`,
and actions after a dialogue, which may be choices

## Inventory System

1. `InventoryManager`: simply manages a list of items the player owns.
2. `InventoryItemController`: Since some items were puzzle items that were meant to be dragged to the environment, each item owned by the player had an `InventoryItemController` that made the items draggable, and store whether it interacted with a certain object in-scene.

# What I've Learnt

1. **Code Architecture**: Using UML diagrams to get a greater sensing of the code architecture and the actors in them.
2. **Code Interfaces**: Make code highly readable by keeping it clean and using interfaces.
3. **Working under pressure**: Successfully deliver a game with a team under a strict time limit.
