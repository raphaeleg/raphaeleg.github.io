Learnt the fundamentals of raytracing and computer graphics by creating my own raytracer using the following guide. This includes...
- Positionable camera with Defocus Blur
- Materials (Diffused, Metal, Dielectrics)
- Antialiasing
- Spheres

Furthermore, the code has been written using my knowledge of modern C++.
