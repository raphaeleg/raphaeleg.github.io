Summon light to find your way out of the dark, dangerous maze. Avoid becoming a fishâ€™s snack! **A 72-hour game jam**

This project was made with **3 people**, including another developer.

Out of 2194 submissions, _Luminth_ was submitted for LudumDare55 and placed...

- **Top 3%** in Graphics
- **Top 7%** in Innovation <Image

Because of the positive reviews, we've decided to continue **polishing the game for 2 months**.

Below talks about my contributions to the project, including some linked posts for further details on the technical implementations.

# My Technical Contributions

---

## 1. Handled the `Lights` class

- Instantiation with dynamic light radiuses
- Hostile Lights that decreased Player's health
- Background Image Masking to "see" the maze <Image

  />

### POST-GAME JAM: Better Light Visuals using Shaders (HLSL)

A huge mechanic of Luminth was the uncovering of the maze through lights. However, Unity doesn't have a built-in function to create transparent circles, needing HLSL Shader expertise.

- Alpha blending
- Texture Copy
- Particle Effects
- Post-Processing (Vignette, Bloom)

## 2. Made the Tutorial Scene

- **Game Event Triggers**
- Level Design
- Dialogue Manager

### POST-GAME JAM: Better Tutorial

Due to the interesting world Luminth had to offer, the original tutorial focused more on narrative to introduce the mechanics. However, we found that **it gave players unclear instructions and expectations**

In the polished version, Luminth's tutorial dialogues went from 27 lines to 5 lines. This gave more focus on **action and visual instructions** than words, making it clearer what players should expect.

## 3. Other Scenes (Main Menu, Winning, Losing, Credits) 
- Button Animations using DOTween

## 4. Randomised Exit Position at every scene instantiation. 

--- 

## 5. WebGL Build published in itch.io

## 6. POST-GAME JAM: Focus Mechanic using Shaders (HLSL)

From the original submission's feedback, we have introduced a new mechanic that helps players find the direction of the exit.

# Soft-skill 

Challenges Because of the tight time constraints, it was necessary
to have clear communication in work delegation and what the game needed. This included
**Task Prioritisation**, **Using GitHub Branches for specific tasks**, and **Agile
Project Management**.

# What I've Learnt 

1. **Completed game:** Successfully completed the game within **72 hours** through effective collaboration, and polished the game with post-processing and publishing. 

2. **Applied knowledge:** Applied knowledge from previous game development experience such as: Shader Language, Level Design, Game Events, Dialogue Manager, and Agile collaboration 

3. **Great feedback:** Showcased at **Hong Kong's Game Dev Happy Hour event**, among other games, and received positive feedback.
