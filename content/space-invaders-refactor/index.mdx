Given a Space Invaders Project produced by junior programmers back at university, I refactored their code to include idiomatic modern C++, clean code and good API design.

# Core Issues

Upon reviewing the codebase, this project's core issue is the constant violation of **Single Responsibility Principle**. Here are a few indicators of how the codebase violates the principle:

1. **Physical structure:** In this project, there are only 3 `.cpp` files <Image
	src='/blogs/spaceinvader-files.png'
	width='150'
	height='150'
	alt='Physical Structure'
	sizes='100vw'
/>
2. **Logical structure:** The `game.cpp` file holds all the objects involved with the game (Projectile, Wall, etc...). As a result, `game.cpp` was **939 lines** long
3. **Three-step initialization:** A lot of objects would be created in a local variable, with a couple of lines changing special parameters, and in some cases, calling a launch function. The object itself isn’t handling itself, but another object. Here's an snippet of Three-step initialisation:

```cpp {1,3,4} title="game.cpp" caption="Although game was initialised and defined, it was still assigned variables, and then had a lesser-known function to _actually_ initialise. This is very unsafe."
Game game = { State::STARTSCREEN };	// from a defined enum State {STARTSCREEN, ...};
Resources resources;
game.resources = resources;
game.Launch();
```


# Immediate Solutions

When dealing with a messy project, it's hard to know where to start. I always like to get my feet stabilised by first making all the logic more readable. Here are some immediate steps I could do.

### One file per object

One easy way to alleviate the violation of Single Responsibility Principle is by giving each defined object a file of it's own. This already reduced `game.cpp` to **367 lines**.

<Image
	src='/blogs/spaceinvader-filesImprov.png'
	width='400'
	height='400'
	alt='Alien, Background, Helper, Leaderboard, Player, Projectile, Renderer, Wall, game, main'
	sizes='100vw'
/>

### More Functions

All meaningful operations were properly packaged into named functions so that the core functions (`Game::Update()`) bacame more readable (as per C++ Core Guidelines F.1). Here is one example:

```cpp title="game.cpp" caption="HandleProjectileHit() does as the name says: handles projectiles in Game::Update()"
void Game::HandleProjectileHit() noexcept {
	// Take care of Out of Bound Projectiles
	RemoveOutOfScreenProjectiles(PlayerProjectiles);
	RemoveOutOfScreenProjectiles(AlienProjectiles);

	// Take care of projectiles that hit walls, decreasing wall health
	RemoveWallHitProjectiles(PlayerProjectiles);
	RemoveWallHitProjectiles(AlienProjectiles);

	// Take care of entity hits, decreasing entity's health
	RemoveAlienHitProjectiles(PlayerProjectiles);
	RemovePlayerHitProjectiles(AlienProjectiles);
}
```

### Group functions

Now that the code was easier to read, it was also easier to understand which responsibilities actually belonged in `game.cpp`. For example, all rendering functions can be grouped into a new class that handles solely rendering.

```cpp title="Renderer.hpp" caption="What was once in game.cpp was given it's own space!"
class Renderer {
	private:
		...
	public:
		[[nodiscard]] int GetPlayerActiveTexture() const noexcept { return playerActiveTexture; }
		[[nodiscard]] bool mouseOnText() const noexcept { return CheckCollisionPointRec(GetMousePosition(), textBox); }
	
		void UpdatePlayerAnimation() noexcept;
		void StartScreen() const noexcept;
		void GameplayText(int score, int lives) const noexcept;
		void DefaultEndScreen() const noexcept;
		void HighscoreScreen(std::string name, int maxChar) noexcept;
};
```

This trimmed `game.cpp` to **223 lines**.

### Better Constructors

Better Constructors was then finally implemented. This minimizes the number of dynamic variables needed for object creation, so that creation only needs one line.

```cpp title="Wall.hpp" caption="A wall object define itself if given a position.."
Wall(const Vector2& pos) noexcept : position(pos) {};
```

```cpp {3} title="game.cpp" caption="..taking only one line to initialise."
for (int i = 0; i < wallCount; i++) {
	const auto pos = Vector2{wallDistance * (i+1), wallsPositionY};	// Position calculations
	Walls.emplace_back(Wall(pos))	// game.cpp holds list `Walls` to contain all walls
} 
```

Not only is it a lot safer, it's also a lot more readable and less complex.

# Advanced Improvements

### RAII

Ensure critical resources such as texture or window is handled properly with constructor, destructor, and exception specifying.

```cpp title="Window.hpp"
class Window {
public:
    Window(const int screenWidth, const int screenHeight, std::string_view title) {
        try {
            InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, title.data());
        }
        catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
            std::println("Error: Could not create window", e.what());
        }
    };
    ~Window() { CloseWindow(); };
    Window(const Window& other) = delete;
    Window operator= (const Window& other) = delete;
    Window(const Window&& other) = delete;
    Window operator= (const Window&& other) = delete;
};
```

This ensures that objects are always created in a valid state.

### Pipelined logic

Reduce complexity by keeping only essential data, and relying more on simple calculations

For example, projectile doesn't need to keep updating a line start/end, just a position that renderer will draw out.

```cpp {11,12} title="game.cpp" caption="Old Projectile Code updating a lineStart and lineEnd"
// --- BEFORE ---
struct Projectile {
public: 
	// INITIALIZE PROJECTILE WHILE DEFINING IF ITS PLAYER OR ENEMY 
	Vector2 position = {0,0};
	int speed = 15; 
	bool active = true;  
	EntityType type = {};

	// LINE WILL UPDATE WITH POSITION FOR CALCULATIONS
	Vector2 lineStart = { 0, 0 };
	Vector2 lineEnd = { 0, 0 };

	void Update();
	void Render(Texture2D texture);
};
```
```cpp {6,9} title="Projectile.hpp" caption="After Refactoring, simply adding to the y position"
// --- AFTER ---
static constexpr int PROJECTILE_LENGTH = 15;
class Projectile {
private:
	int speed = 15;
	Vector2 position = { 0, 0 };
public:
	Projectile(Vector2 pos, bool isPlayerProjectile) noexcept;
	void Update() noexcept { position.y += speed; };
	void Render(Texture2D texture) const noexcept;
	[[nodiscard]] Vector2 GetPosition() const noexcept { return position; }
	[[nodiscard]] bool IsOutOfScreen() const noexcept { return GetPosition().y < 0 || GetPosition().y > GetScreenHeightF(); }
};
```

### Modern C++

Seen throughout this post, you can see that Modern C++ was adhered. Here are some examples:
- `.hpp` files specifying that the code is only meant to be read using C++.
- Sticking to simple datatypes that doesn't need custom destructors, copy/move constructors nor assignments, Adhering to the Rule of 0
- `for-range` loops
- `static_cast` over c-style cast if necessary
- using `std::algorithms` (`remove_if()`, `for_each()`, etc...)
- `auto`, `[[nodiscard]]`, `constexpr`, `noexcepts`

# Results: 939→184 lines

1. **939→184 lines**: After this refactor, game.cpp turned from 939 to 18 lines, which proves that Single Responsibility Principle is a lot less violated.
2. **Readability**: Because all meaningful operations and values have been stored and named, the code reads like English.
3. **Modern C++**: Using C++ Core Guidelines, textbooks and C++ Convention Talks, motivated decisions were properly sourced to improve the code

# How to further improve this?

1. **State Machine**: Further adhere to Single Responsibility Principle by implementing a state machine handling different states
2. **Bug in `OwnTexture`**: The special member operations are not handling all the members of the class, which means a copied texture will take an `undefined _path`.
3. **Greater optimisation**: The code could be further optimised. Examples include using `auto-lambda` templates, `string_view`, and less unnecessary copy with `emplace_back`.
