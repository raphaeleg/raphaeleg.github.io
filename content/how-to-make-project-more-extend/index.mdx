During my [refactoring process of my game jam game](/blogs/when-stars-collapse-refactor), I wanted to find a way that made it easy to also **extend** from the original code, such that it was easy to add more features and content if desired. Here are four ways I achieved this.


# 1. Outer-class extendability: Events Manager
One way to make code more easily extendable was through **the way objects received data**. Compared to the previous way of passing a reference to an entire object, I decided to pass data through Events.

### Event Manager Script
I created a **singleton** `EventsManager` class, holding a global `eventsDictionary` of all the listeners and events that each object listens to. This gave each script the freedom to **listen and trigger events anytime anywhere**.

Here is my EventsManager script. It has three basic functions: `StartListening`, `StopListening`, and `TriggerEvent`. Each event additionally supports **integer data passing**. This means that whenever an event is Triggered, some integer value can also be sent to the listeners.
```cs title="EventManager.cs"
public class EventManager : MonoBehaviour {
	// Global EventManager instance, and eventDictionary.
	public static EventManager Instance = null;
	public static Dictionary<string, Action<int>> eventDictionary;

	// As a singleton class, ensure that there only exist one instance of EventManager.
	void Awake() {
		if (Instance != null) {
			Destroy(gameObject);
			return;
		}
		Instance = this;
		eventDictionary = new Dictionary<string, Action<int>>();
	}
	
	public static void StartListening(string eventName, Action<int> listener) {
		Action<int> thisEvent;
		if (eventDictionary.TryGetValue(eventName, out thisEvent)) {
			thisEvent += listener;
			eventDictionary[eventName] = thisEvent;
		}
		else {
			thisEvent += listener;
			eventDictionary.Add(eventName, thisEvent);
		}
	}
	public static void StopListening(string eventName, Action<int> listener) {
		Action<int> thisEvent;
		if (eventDictionary.TryGetValue(eventName, out thisEvent)) {
			thisEvent -= listener;
			eventDictionary[eventName] = thisEvent;
		}
	}
	public static void TriggerEvent(string eventName, int i) {
		Action<int> thisEvent = null;
		if (eventDictionary.TryGetValue(eventName, out thisEvent)) {
			thisEvent?.Invoke(i);
		}
	}
}
```

### Example Usage
Let's say we have a Meteor. By clicking on a Meteor, it "loads" a MeteorBar.

One way we could have done this is for whenever a meteor is clicked, to find an object named "meteor bar", and directly update a certain variable that loads the meteor bar once. But what if Unity cannot find such object? What if we had 10 different types of meteors and meteor bars?

Events answers those questions.

First, let's **trigger** the fact that a meteor was clicked.

```cs {5} title="Meteor.cs" caption="Let's say we trigger a 'CollectMeteor' Event"
namespace Meteors {
	public class Meteor : MonoBehaviour {
		// ...
		private void OnMouseDown() {
			EventManager.TriggerEvent("CollectMeteor", 1);
			Destroy(gameObject);
		}
		// ...
	}
}
```
Next, we can let the meteor bar class **listen** for a "CollectMeteor" Event.

```cs /Event_AddMeteor/ caption="By pairing the Event_AddMeteor method to this event, it will automatically run this method, with a passed integer data."
namespace Runes 
{
	public class MeteorBar : MonoBehaviour {
		int collectedMeteors = 0;
		#region Event Listener
			private void OnEnable() {
				EventManager.StartListening("CollectMeteor", Event_AddMeteor);
			}
			private void OnDisable() {
				EventManager.StopListening("CollectMeteor", Event_AddMeteor);
			}
		#endregion
		public void Event_AddMeteor(int val) {
			collectedMeteors += val;
		}
	}
}
```

Notice how these two scripts are in different namespaces, yet are still able to interact freely.

### A more complicated, successful example
<Image
	src='/blogs/starscollapse-diagram1.png'
	width='1000'
	height='250'
	alt='Planets'
	sizes='100vw'
/>

As seen, because rune interactions happen through events, each part of the rune **doesn't need a reference to it's neighbours**, only the **data needed**. Furthermore, it's easy and safe to **extend** the runes system, either adding or removing parts of the system, as only the events involved needs to be updated.

# 2. Outer-class extendability: Enums
Now let's say that there are three different Meteors, and three different Meteor Bars, and they can only connect to it's same type of `RED`, `GREEN`, `BLUE`. 

One way we can _extend_ the current code is by giving each object a "Faction", where all **Meteors** and **Runes** belong to a faction. Here is a base class:
```cs title="Faction.cs"
public class Faction : MonoBehaviour {
	public enum Type { BLUE, GREEN, RED };
	public Type type;

	public Faction(Type t) { this.type = t; }
}
```

### Attaching it to our Events
Alright, so we can attach this script to our meteor and meteor bar, and instantiate them in some way, but how do we check whether they have been triggered?

Knowing that events are simply strings, we can actually use a suffix on the event name, like so:
```cs {7-15} title="Faction.cs"
public class Faction : MonoBehaviour {
	public enum Type { BLUE, GREEN, RED };
	public Type type;

	public Faction(Type t) { this.type = t; }

	public string StringType() {
		return type switch {
			Type.RED => "Red",
			Type.GREEN => "Green",
			Type.BLUE => "Blue",
			_ => "Unknown",
		};
	}
	public string StringType(string prefix) { return prefix + "_" + StringType(); }
}
```
Now whenever we call `StringType("xyz")`, it should return a string "xyz_Red".
```cs {3,6} title="Meteor.cs"
namespace Meteors {
	public class Meteor : MonoBehaviour {
		private Faction faction;
		// ...
		private void OnMouseDown() {
			EventManager.TriggerEvent(faction.StringType("CollectMeteor"), 1);
			Destroy(gameObject);
		}
		// ...
	}
}
```
```cs {2,6,7,10}
public class MeteorBar : MonoBehaviour {
	private Faction faction;
	int collectedMeteors = 0;
	#region Event Listener
		private void OnEnable() {
			faction = transform.GetComponent<Faction>();
			EventManager.StartListening(faction.StringType("CollectMeteor"), Event_AddMeteor);
		}
		private void OnDisable() {
			EventManager.StopListening(faction.StringType("CollectMeteor"), Event_AddMeteor);
		}
	#endregion
	public void Event_AddMeteor(int val) {
		collectedMeteors += val;
	}
}
```
This is so powerful because now **we can make as many "Factions" as we want**, to map to the certain Meteor and Meteor bar.

# 3. Inner-class extendability: Finite State Machine
Now that we've covered different class interaction, what about extending a system?

In my case, I had a Planets class that I realised had **different states**, yet had **sharable behaviours**. This called for a **Finite State Machine** (FSM) of four main states: `Begin`, `Sick`, `BlackHole`, `WhiteDwarf`. Each state can do the following actions: `Start()`, `Collided()`,  or `ShrinkUntilDestroy()`.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The idea of a """Finite""" State Machine implies that the code is in fact, not easily extendable. However, an FSM helps streamline the logic of how the object should behave, in a way making it easier to **track and add** new features to the object, relative to one big Manager class.
<Image
	src='/blogs/starscollapse-planets.png'
	width='600'
	height='250'
	alt='Planets'
	sizes='100vw'
/>
Using the same `Faction` enum, I first made some **abstract** `StateMachine` and `State` classes, that were **easily extendable** to any sort of object, like planets:
<Image
	src='/blogs/starscollapse-diagram2.png'
	width='900'
	height='250'
	alt='Planets'
	sizes='100vw'
/>
### FSM Script
It was as easy as the following: 
```cs title="StateMachine.cs"
public abstract class StateMachine : MonoBehaviour {
    protected State State;

    public void SetState(State state) {
        State = state;
        StartCoroutine(State.Start());
    }
}
```
```cs title="State.cs"
public abstract class State {
	protected Planet Planet;

	public State(Planet planet) {
		Planet = planet;
	}
	// Virtual methods to be overridden.
	public virtual IEnumerator Start() {
		yield break;
	}
	public virtual IEnumerator Collided(Collider2D other) {
		yield break;
	}
	// Ensure that this function is being called at the right states
	public virtual void ShrinkUntilDestroy(GameObject collider) {
		Planet.GetComponent<Anim_Shrink>().ShrinkUntilDestroy(collider);
	}
}
```
```cs title="Planet.cs"
public class Planet : StateMachine {
	public Faction faction { get; private set; }

	// Added methods that determined the switching of states
	public void Start() {
		faction = GetComponent<Faction>();
		SetState(new Begin(this));
	}
	public void ShrinkUntilDestroy(GameObject other) {
		State.ShrinkUntilDestroy(other);
	}
	public void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other) {
		StartCoroutine(State.Collided(other));
	}
	public void OnDestroy() {
		Destroy(gameObject);
	}
}
```
### Benefits
This gives the same benefits as the Events, where each state only needs to know **it's own relevant data**, as there are some state-specific data. For example, Black Holes and White Dwarfs doesn't have a faction, but a Sick Planet does. 

Now, if a planet ever has a new state, it simply needs to create a new `State` file, and a way it's triggered. Furthermore, if states every have a new feature, such as the `ShrinkUntilDestroy()` method, it simply needs to update the `State.cs` file, and override the virtual function for the relevant states it affects.        

# 4. Inner-class extendability: Generalization

Finally, the last time I can share is on generalisation.

Let's say you have to create a scene that does the following animations:
<Image
	src='/blogs/starscollapse-highscore.gif'
	width='700'
	height='250'
	alt='Planets'
	sizes='100vw'
/>

What you could do under a heavy time limit is to hard-code all the possible elements that needs to appear, and copy-paste all the coroutines needed, with a slight change of what the next coroutine should be.

Approaching this script, the Highscore Scene is extremely animation-heavy and object heavy. The best thing to do was the make as many generalisations and prefabs as possible. This was achieved in two ways:

1. Making **Prefab** text containers so that every object had the same “base” and only changed the text string. This helped ensure that the objects had a "standard" to reference from.
2. A general `AnimationData` struct for each Score (Time, Stars Collected, Stars Saved) that held the constant texts (title, labels), the base score, the animation to flip the numbers to reveal a result score.

### Organising all the objects into a struct

Expanding on the second point, we first have to identify what objects are there for one section of a score:
```cs title="ScoreboardManager.cs"
[Serializable] public struct AnimationData {
	[Header("Constant Text")]
	public GameObject Title;
	public GameObject Label;
	public GameObject MulLabel;
	[Header("Base Value")]
	public GameObject BaseValObj;
	private TMP_Text BaseValStr;
	[Header("Score Value")]
	public GameObject ScoreValObj;
	public int ScoreVal { get; private set; }
	public TMP_Text ScoreValStr { get; private set; }
}
```
Wew... That's a lot. But that doesn't mean we need to pass 8 objects for every section, we can actually just pass in 5!
```cs caption="Constructor"
[Serializable] public struct AnimationData {
	[Header("Constant Text")]
	public GameObject Title;
	public GameObject Label;
	public GameObject MulLabel;
	[Header("Base Value")]
	public GameObject BaseValObj;
	private TMP_Text BaseValStr;
	[Header("Score Value")]
	public GameObject ScoreValObj;
	public int ScoreVal { get; private set; }
	public TMP_Text ScoreValStr { get; private set; }

	public AnimationData(GameObject t, GameObject l, GameObject mL, GameObject bVS, GameObject sVS) {
		Title = t;
		Label = l;
		MulLabel = mL;
		BaseValObj = bVS;
		BaseValStr = bVS ? bVS.GetComponent<TMP_Text>() : null;
		ScoreValObj = sVS;
		ScoreVal = 0;
		ScoreValStr = sVS.GetComponent<TMP_Text>();
		ScoreValStr.text = "";
	}
}
```
Now that we have a struct that organises one score section, let's make a List that holds each section, and fill it up from the inspector.

<Image
	src='/blogs/starscollapse-scoreManager.png'
	width='300'
	height='250'
	alt='Planets'
	sizes='100vw'
/>

It already feels a lot easier to manage all the objects.

### Utilising the struct in a function

Regarding the appearing of the objects, or the coroutines, let's make three main ones instead of 18, that **loops through our generalised struct**.
```cs {13-16}
public class Scoreboard : MonoBehaviour {
	// ...
	private const float DELAY = 0.5f;
	private const float DELAY_SECTION = DELAY*4;
	[Serializable] public struct AnimationData {
		// ...
	}
	void Start() {
		// ...
		StartCoroutine(Sequence());
	}
	private IEnumerator Sequence() {
		foreach (AnimationData data in animationList) {
			StartCoroutine(Sequence(data));
			yield return new WaitForSeconds(DELAY_SECTION);
		}
		CTA.SetActive(true);
	}
	IEnumerator Sequence(AnimationData data) {
		yield return new WaitForSeconds(DELAY);
		EventManager.TriggerEvent("SFX_ScoreAppear", 0);
		data.Title.SetActive(true);
		data.Label.SetActive(true);
		data.MulLabel.SetActive(true);
		yield return new WaitForSeconds(DELAY);
		EventManager.TriggerEvent("SFX_ScoreAppear", 0);
		data.BaseValObj.SetActive(true);
		data.ScoreValObj.SetActive(true);
		StartCoroutine(ScoreFlip(data.ScoreValStr, data.ScoreVal));
	}
	IEnumerator ScoreFlip(TMP_Text text, int realScore) {
		// ...
	}
}
```
This made the code a lot more readable, as now to reveal each score, we only need to loop through a List of `AnimationData` and call one `Sequence()` method that triggered that Score section animation.


Now that the code is a lot less hard-coded, it's easier to see how we may add new score sections (e.g. the number of Black Holes in the game) and touch less of the logic it takes to show everything.


# Conclusion

I would say that making a class extendable is all about **finding the obvious and repeated behaviours, and extracting that to make a generalised class**. Hopefully, these small tricks and patterns will help you find how to make your code not only easier to extend from, but also cleaner to read.
