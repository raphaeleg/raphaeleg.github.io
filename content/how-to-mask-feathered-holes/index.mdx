A huge mechanic of Luminth was the uncovering of the maze through lights. However, Unity doesn't have a built-in function to create transparent circles, needing technical expertise.

# Primitive Solution

Within 72 hours, the best solution was using the **stencil buffer**, to reject pixels on the cloud texture based on a circle image attached with the light.

<Image

	width='500'
	height='500'
	alt='timeline'
	sizes='100vw'
/>

This worked using two stencil buffer materials. The first one passing a ref of 1 with no color, and the second checks if the stencil buffer is not equal to 1 to draw. This was initially done with regular materials since it was a 2D image, but it can be replicated with ShaderLab.

```hlsl title="Mask.shader" caption="Always write 1 for the entirety of this object"
...
Stencil {
	Ref 1
	Comp Always
	Pass Replace
}
ColorMask 0
...
```

```hlsl title="Obj.shader" caption="If the stencil buffer is not equal to 1, keep the original value"
...
Stencil {
	Ref 1
	Comp NotEqual
	Pass Keep
}
...
```

Benefits:

- Easy to implement
- Easy to use with any GameObject

Disadvantages:

- The edges are too harsh for the intended effect.

We can't get any further with stencil / masking as it only holds integers (not floating points). It literally **accept or reject pixels**.

# Polished Solution

There exist many solutions based on seeing players through walls, but the applications are mainly 3D, and uses ShaderGraph from URP. Let's look at how we can write a solution based in HLSL.

### 1. Draw a transparent, soft circle on texture.

```hlsl title="Clouds.shader" caption="1.1. SubShader Characteristics"
Tags { RenderType = Transparent, Queue = Transparent }
Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusAlpha
```

```hlsl title="Clouds.shader" caption="1.2. Define a circle function"
void drawCircle(in float2 uv, in float2 center, in float radius, in float smooth, out float output) {
	// Using Signed Distance from the center
	float sqrDistance = (uv.x - center.x) * (uv.x - center.x) + (uv.y - center.y) * (uv.y - center.y);
	float sqrRadius = radius * radius;
	if (sqrDistance < radius) {
		output = smoothstep(sqrRadius, sqrRadius-smoothValue, sqrDistance);
	} else { output = 0; }
}
```

```hlsl title="Clouds.shader" caption="1.3. Integrate the circle function with the frag Function"
fixed4 frag(v2f i) : SV_Target {
	fixed4 col = tex2D(_MainTex, i.uv);
	drawCircle(i.uv, center, radius, smoothstepValue, outputAlpha);	// Defined properties
	return col * (1,1,1,1-outputAlpha);
}
```

### 2. Dynamically draw a circle

Since it's planned to have multiple circles, the data structure will be an array.

```hlsl /_Points/ title="Clouds.shader" caption="2.1. Define a data structure that reads points to make holes"
sampler2D _MainTex;
float4 _MainTex_ST;
float4 _Points[100];	// The variable being modified. Capped at 100.
```

```cs /_Points/ title="Clouds.cs" caption="2.2. Use a C# script to populate the variable with data"
public class Clouds : MonoBehaviour {
	public Material m;
	public Texture2D t;
	Vector4[] lights;

	void NewLight(Vector4 v) {
		lights[0] = v;
		m.SetVectorArray("_Points", lights);	// Updates the data the shader will use
	}

	void Start() {
		Vector4 v = new(x, y, radius, 0);	// The defined data structure
		NewLight(v);
	}
}
```

```hlsl {3-5} title="Clouds.shader" caption="2.3. Use the variables to make a circle"
fixed4 frag(v2f i) : SV_Target {
	fixed4 col = tex2D(_MainTex, i.uv);
	float center = _Points[0].xy;
	float radius = _Points[0].z;
	float smoothValue = radius / 20;	// Feathering based on radius
	drawCircle(i.uv, center, radius, smoothValue, outputAlpha);	// Defined properties
	return col * (1,1,1,1-outputAlpha);
}
```

Once it's possible to pass one variable of points, it's easy to pass an array of points using a counter and a for-loop. I won't go through that here.

### 3. World Coordinates to UV Coordinates

The last challenge is properly covering the world coordinates to the correct UV coordinates.

- In World Space, the coordinates align on an axis
- In Texture Space, the coordinates starts at the bottom-left, and range from (0 ~ 1).

**To translate world to texture:**

1. Get point x<sub>world</sub>, center<sub>world</sub> (the offset from (0,0)<sub>world</sub>), and center<sub>texture</sub> (by dividing the total texture size by 2)
2. Find how far x<sub>world</sub> is from center<sub>world</sub> as distance<sub>world</sub>
3. x<sub>texture</sub> = center<sub>texture</sub> + distance<sub>world</sub>
4. To translate to uv Space, normalise x<sub>texture</sub> to size<sub>texture</sub> so it's within 0 ~ 1 values
   - Make sure to use `spriteRenderer.size` instead of Texture2D.width or height

```cs
Vector2 size = sprRend.size;
Vector2 centerT = size/2;

Vector3 centerW = gameObject.transform.localPosition;

Vector2 distance = x - centerW;

Vector2 xT = distance + centerT;
Vector2 nXT = xT / size;

lights[j] = new(nXT.x, nXT.y, x.z, 0);	// push to _Points array!
```

This is how Gradient Holes are made!

Be careful, since we're using a C# script to send data to the GPU, a lot of data from CPU will be passed down to GPU, potentially becoming a bottleneck if there's a large amount of data to send. (Specifically, O(max_lights, 4 floats) = O(100*4*4) = O(1600 bytes))

If I were to continue improving this, I would also look into simplifying the calculations by manipulating the `vert` function in the shader file.
