If you recall from the [previous post](/blogs/how-to-mask-feathered-holes), Luminth was able to render lights , illuminating the maze. But what about the player?

A good way to show where the player is in the mist of clouds is with a _silhouette_. This will require a copying of the player sprite on top of the clouds texture.

## 1. Define a player box, the position and space the player takes in the texture

```hlsl caption="This requires a _PlayerData property, that should be passed using a C# script"
v2f vert(appData v) {
	...
	float2 playerOrigin = _PlayerData.xy;
	float2 playerRelativeScale = _PlayerData.zw;
	o.playerBox = playerRelativeScale * (v.uv - playerOrigin);
}
```

## 2. Define the function to draw a full silhouette copy of the player

```hlsl caption="Taking the player's sprite, and outputting a clean, gray-colored version of it"
fixed4 renderSilhouette(fixed4 col, float2 playerBox) {
	// Get the Player Texture Color
	fixed4 player = tex2D(_PlayerSprite, playerBox);
	// Fill the sprite transparent areas with the underlying background
	// This will render the silhouette player at all times
	// if player.a = 0, draw the clouds
	// if player.a = 1, draw the player
	return lerp(col, _SilhouetteColor.rgba, player.a);
}
```

## 3. Draw the silhouette, before the alpha blending of the cloud holes

```hlsl
fixed4 frag(v2f i) : SV_Target {
	fixed4 col = tex2D(_CloudTex, i.uv);

	// Within the bounds of the player texture at it's position
	if(i.playerBox.x > 0 && i.playerBox.x < 1) {
		if(i.playerBox.y > 0 && i.playerBox.y < 1) {
			col = renderSilhouette(col, i.playerBox);
		}
	}

	col = renderCloudHoles(col, i.uv);
	return col;
}
```

It was a lot more simpler than initially anticipated! I believe that there should be a better way to write out o.playerBox, but this implementation 100% works.
