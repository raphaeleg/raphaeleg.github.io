Vulkan is a graphics API that stands out for it's low-level access to the GPU, enabling better optimization and multi-threading support, which improves efficiency for complex applications. It's a popular API for many game studios. Having previously written code for [OpenGL](https://github.com/raphaeleg/BasicRenderer) and [DirectX11](https://github.com/raphaeleg/DirectX11_Basics), I wanted to see for myself how powerful Vulkan can be.

I was largely following along [Brendan Galea's Vulkan Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) not only for his amazing clean code architecture, but also his thourough explanations in how Vulkan communicates with the GPU.
