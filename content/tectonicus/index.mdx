Interned at Gamucatex for 2 months as a Software Engineer in C#. Heavily contributed towards the pre-production development of _Tectonicus: At the Edge of War_.

I'm unable to share any source code, but I am able to describe my contributions and experience.

# Background

Gamucatex had undergone structural changes, resulting in a highly **flexible team** of developers.

To adapt to these changes, I worked on **refactoring** the codebase for better adaptability, and effectively **communicating** the development progress.

These efforts had a **significant impact on the pre-production successes of Gamucatex**.

## Exclusive features for game's showcase at Roskilde Festival

My onboarding task was to develop key exclusive features for showcasing Tectonicus at the 2023 Roskilde Festival, Northern Europe's largest music and arts festival

| The button enabled the game to run on a lower FPS and lower resolution graphics, becoming more energy-efficient. | - Created additional card data of whether the players have a specific card<br/>- Created a function that takes a unique string to gift the user new cards.<br/><br/>This feature had to be written in generic code so that game designers could enter any number of exclusive strings and cards they wanted. |

## Refactoring the codebase's architecture

In the game, players use cards that represent units with specific abilities to win. However, the current class architecture for these units is limited in supporting a wider range of required abilities.

	sizes='100vw'
/>

To address this, I worked on refactoring the units class to make it easier for future developers and designers to add unique abilities.

For instance, I added a parameter for ability duration that spans more than one turn. To achieve this, I had to keep track of the number of turns that had passed in the ability class.

However, I encountered a challenge when I had to determine what happens for an ability that triggers indefinitely during a battle. Thus, I required the game class to explicitly examine each instance of such ability.

## Directions to better UX/UI

Previously, the game lacked a specialized focus on UXUI, which was a major issue at Roskilde Festival. Having experience in UXUI, I collaborated with developers and artists to improve the game's interface.

/>

We communicated technically to achieve the UXUI designer's vision (such as file type, size, and layers needed), leading to a comprehensive action plan and streamlined task delegation between departments.

## Friendly Documentation

Technical documentation is crucial not only for future developers, but also for game designers to understand the developer's work better.

During my tenure, I extensively reworked the technical documentation to make it more reader-friendly and efficient for onboarding.

The process involved eliminating outdated information, adding more test cases, providing examples of certain features, and refining the standard development process in code, SCRUM cards, and version control.

# Legacy

Through my contributions in...

1. Refactoring the codebase's architecture to support more features, and
2. Greatly communicating with cross-functional teams to improve the cross-disciplinary field of UX/UI;

I positively impacted the pre-production development of _Tectonicus: At the Edge of War_.

# What I've Learnt

1. **Complex architecture**: Refactoring the card abilities gave me a glimpse of managing complex architectures
2. **Agile and Scrum**: Experienced two full **sprint cycles**, including code reviews and version control.
3. **Collaboration**: Worked with many people in different departments from documentation to initiatives, and saw my work in the **grander pipeline**.
